<p>A bitter feud has erupted on Twitter between two of Sydney's top chefs, escalating from an alleged joke into a tirade of insults about their wives, children and mothers. My Kitchen Rules star Colin Fassnidge and Nathan Sasi from fashionable Surry Hills eatery Nomad begun the inflamed exchange on Wednesday on the social media platform. The war of words reportedly started when Fassnidge tweeted a remark about a tomato and mozzarella dish that was served at rival restaurant Nomad, reports the Daily Telegraph.

<p>By Mark Duell PUBLISHED: 03:53 EST, 1 October 2012 | UPDATED: 11:48 EST, 1 October 2012 Bookies were counting the cost of Europe's Ryder Cup victory after a stunning final-day comeback was rounded off by a remarkable gesture of sportsmanship by America's Tiger Woods. Jose Maria Olazabal's side recorded a 14½ to 13½ outright win in Medinah, Illinois, following a string of heroic performances by the likes of Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy. They played their part in ensuring Europe retained the trophy they won two years ago, but it was Woods who handed them outright victory in the final match of the tournament.<br/>

<p>I just caught this on Showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the "secret base" was the house from Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. If Tattoo had gotten eaten by the snake, I might have given this movie a 2, but oh well. Watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the Komodo or the cobra loomed over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny, especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster. I nearly fell out of my chair, though, when in a flashback scene they brought in either the cobra or the komodo - then normal size - in some indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it. Wouldn't a wire cage have sufficed? LOL! Guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. I have to remember I rent Showtime for their series and not their movies. <span class='instruction'>What is the sentiment expressed in this text?</span></p></div>

Title: </span>Broken after 2 months<br/>
<span class='instruction'>Review: </span>EDIT: 2 Months after installation it stopped making ice. Not too sure if it is the ice maker itself is broken or the valve that controls water flow.Shipping was fast and vender processed order next day. For the ice maker itself, it was very easy to install on my Frigidaire refrigerator. However the back of the fridge was missing some of the clearance holes to mount the valve on the back of the fridge so you might have to drill a couple holes. Other than that no problem.Makes ice just fine (you'll want to run the water line out for a good 10-15 minutes before hooking up to the back of the fridge or your ice will taste weird for a few batches. Not too sure how fast a batch is supposed to be made but it seems like it does about 2-3 batches of ice per day which is a bit on the slow side compared to other ice makers I have used (the only reason for taking a star away).<br/>

<p>This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side Of the Mountain", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like "Trapper". However, as I got older I found I was just too domesticated to live like that. Nonetheless, I still romanticize about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this movie that the storyline has the simplicity that is quite prevalent in "Disneyisque" type movies, but if you can look past the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true themes, then I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make it a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still get a chill running through me when I see torrent of snow rushing down the mountainside and hear the echoing, haunting laugh of the Trapper.<br /><br />-Good luck old-timer and stay free-<br /><br />PS If you want to read more about the true story, I found this link on the Mad Trapper of Rat River:<br /><br />http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/NWT/madtrapper.htm <span class='instruction'>The sentiment expressed for the movie is</span></p></div>

<p>Dog Bite Dog isn't going to be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slapping, stabbing and shooting (but don't worry the lead's a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent romp through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister. Despite being filthy from his journey, he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant. If this sounds wildly implausible to you, you should probably avoid this film. It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief, and I had a lot more fun for it.<br /><br />Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai walks a fine line that has Internal Affairs investigating him, and his father, a legendary Good Cop, is in a coma following a drug deal that went south (the implication is that Wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings).<br /><br />There are a car crashes, lots of killings, and a strange and awkward love story on offer here, all played out in almost comic-book style. I suspect the humour was deliberate (nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd), though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members. There are at least three points where the film might have ended, and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing, or the deletion of one of the narrative threads (the light-hearted stuff worked well, so I would have left out the interactions with the three fathers).<br /><br />I'm inclined to give it a (high) pass, however, if only because of the ending I've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment.

<span class='instruction'>Review: </span>I got this book for my infants at the childcare center I work at. I started reading it to a child and had to stop after a few pages. I flipped ahead hoping that there would be some moral at the end. Basically after trying to pick a fight with a bunch of animals, the ladybug accidentally gets slapped by a whale and gives up and says one nice phrase on the last page. Otherwise the language used in the book is not appropriate for very young children (very rude and sassy) And you cannot really explain the "moral" if that is what you want to call it. If you really want to get this book I would suggest that the age be 7+. I wouldn't read it to my 6 year old, I know that the only thing he would get out of it would be the imfamous phrase that repeats throughout the book... "Do you want to fight."<br/>

<p>It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to that. Let's dissect it... It's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it. Sounds impressive right? But unfortunately the film is not.<br /><br />Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday. His dream is to perform in Wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name. He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a ravishing Priya (Asin). Together they form "London Dreams" their dream band. After impressing the chief of a record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life, to join their band. Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later Arjun become envious for Mannu's superior skills and his affair with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to blight Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the movies.<br /><br />Coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha whom we have admired in Namaste London. Felt like he simply visualized the screenplay. To cut it short, a glorified cameraman. Screenplay by Suresh Nair dulls even though it has its moments. Defined in a predictable fashion, the screenplay bore you to stiff. Camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of London. It's the only entertaining part while watching songs.<br /><br />Few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and he irks you. Asin is forgettable and I don't that she will make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strictly OK.

Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy<br/>
The 2018–19 FIA Formula E season is the fifth season of the FIA Formula E championship, a motor racing championship for electrically-powered vehicles recognised by motorsport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), as the highest class of competition for electric open-wheel racing cars.<br/>
<br/>
The 2018–19 season saw the introduction of the all-new Gen2, second generation Formula E car, which boasts significant technological advances over the previous Spark-Renault SRT_01E chassis – with its power output rising from 200kW to 250kW and top speeds rising to around 280km/h (174mph). The arrival of the Gen2 car also sees an end to the series’ mid-race car-swaps.[1]<br/>
Frenchman Jean-Éric Vergne enters as the defending Drivers’ Champion after securing his first title at the New York City ePrix,[2] while Audi Sport Abt Schaeffler return as defending Teams’ Champions – having beaten Vergne's Techeetah team by a narrow two point margin.[3]<br/>
Teams and drivers<br/>
<br/>
Team changes<br/>
BMW entered Formula E as a manufacturer, partnering with Andretti Autosport.[28]<br/>
Mercedes affiliate HWA entered the championship and establish a technical partnership with Venturi. The agreement sees HWA receive powertrains for the 2018–19 season, serving as a precursor to Mercedes' entry as a manufacturer team in the 2019–20 season.[33]<br/>
Nissan entered the championship as a manufacturer replacing partner company Renault in their partnership with DAMS.[34] Renault cited a desire to concentrate on their Formula One programme as their motivation for leaving Formula E.[21]<br/>
Techeetah switched from a Renault to DS Automobiles powertrain, becoming DS Performance's partner.[35] Meanwhile, Virgin Racing will switch to using an Audi powertrain.[36]<br/>

<br/>
"A necessary condition for the aforementioned reciprocity property is that the materials in the antenna and transmission medium are linear and reciprocal. Reciprocal (or bilateral) means that the material has the same response to an electric current or magnetic field in one direction, as it has to the field or current in the opposite direction. Most materials used in antennas meet these conditions, but some microwave antennas use high-tech components such as isolators and circulators, made of nonreciprocal materials such as ferrite. These can be used to give the antenna a different behavior on receiving than it has on transmitting, which can be useful in applications like radar.",<br/>

Question: </span>Who finds a document showing Ivan hanged by Germans?<br/>
<span class='instruction'>Movie plot title: </span>My Name is Ivan<br/>
<span class='instruction'>Movie plot: </span>On the Eastern front during World War II, the Soviet army is fighting the invading German Wehrmacht. The film features a non-linear plot with frequent flashbacks.<br/>
After a brief dream sequence, Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call "Number 51 at Headquarters" and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivan's mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov.<br/>
Burning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the Maly Trostenets extermination camp (which he mentions that he has seen).<br/>
A subplot involves Captain Kholin and his aggressive advances towards a pretty army nurse, Masha, and Galtsev's own undeclared and unrequited feelings for her. Much of the film is set in a room where the officers await orders and talk, while Ivan awaits his next mission. On the walls are scratched the last messages of doomed prisoners of the Germans.<br/>
Finally, Kholin and Galtsev ferry Ivan...</p></div>

Question: </span>What destroys Mrs. Ritter's house?<br/>
<span class='instruction'>Title: </span>Dark Night of the Scarecrow<br/>
<span class='instruction'>Movie plot: </span>In a small nameless town in the Deep South, "Bubba" Ritter (Larry Drake), a large but gentle retarded man, befriends young 10-year-old Marylee Williams, (Tonya Crowe). Some of the townspeople are upset by the friendship between Marylee and Bubba, and the brooding, mean-spirited postman Otis Hazelrigg (Charles Durning) is the worst. When Marylee is almost killed by a vicious dog (Bubba saves her) and lies unconscious at a doctor's office, Otis promptly assumes that Bubba has murdered (and likely raped) her. Otis and three friends - gas station attendant Skeeter Norris and farmer-cousins Philby and Harliss Hocker - form a lynch mob. They chase Bubba to his mother (Jocelyn Brando)'s house. She believes her son and they play "the Hiding Game": disguising Bubba as a scarecrow and posting him in a nearby field to wait for the drama to cool down. Otis' bloodhounds sniff Bubba out, however, and all four vigilantes empty multiple rounds from their guns into him, killing him. Afterwards, they discover that Marylee is in fact alive, thanks to Bubba, whom they have just murdered. Acting fast, Otis places a pitchfork in Bubba's lifeless hands to make it appear as if he were attacking them with a weapon.In court, Otis and his fellow vigilantes swear they acted in self-defense. Bubba's mother denounces her son's killers before the courtroom, stating, "You may think that you're getting off free, but there's other justice in this world, besides the law!" only to be ejected by the bailiff. Sam Willock, the local district attorney, does not believe the vigilantes' self-defense story, but he cannot make the murder case stick due to a lack of witnesses. The vigilantes go free, but Sam calls after them: "Hazelrigg, just a minute. I want to tell you "men" one thing. I think you executed that man. And I promise you this; If I ever find a single shred of evidence, I'll see every one of you on Death row!"That night, Otis and the rest of his friends celebrate their freedom at a local bar with several locals who stand by them and...</p></div>

Article: </span>For a commuter rushito catch a train, a minute can mean the difference<br/>
between dinner with the family and foods in the microwave. What most passengers don't realize<br/>
is that their minute is already there.<br/>
    Every commuter train that departs from New York Cityabout 900 a d<br/>
leaves a minute later than scheduled. If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at<br/>
8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You<br/>
have two.<br/>
    The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private<br/>
timetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and<br/>
onto the train.<br/>
    "If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing<br/>
unimportant things," explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad.<br/>
Told of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. "Don't blow our cover!"she said.<br/>
    Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the<br/>
railroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy. The railroad industry helped invent the concept*<br/>
of standard time, and time zones were established in the United States in the 1880s, 35 years<br/>
before they were written into law. And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute<br/>
it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is<br/>
carried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles,<br/>
Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades.<br/>
    "That's been done forever, from my knowledge," said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial<br/>
historian of Metro-North. "I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case<br/>
since 1870 for all I know."<br/>

<p>The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military...<br/>

One day, a woman named Suzy Belmont (Marcia Knight) and her brother Phil (Phil Triola) comes around, claiming to be looking for the Rowe's plane mechanic Frankie Bonner (Titus Moede). Beth claims that Frankie was fired for being drunk on the job, but feels that Suzy didn't come down just to see Frankie. As she walks away, Beth can't help but feel that her husband is having an affair with this floozy. It turns out that Harry is, but is still keeping it a secret from his wife. One evening, they receive a letter from Harry's friend, Joe Moss (Eric Tomlin). Joe wants to visit and is looking for a job. Beth recommends to Harry that Joe could easily fill Frankie's position, to which Harry gives his consent that it's okay with him.<br/>

Phineas and Ferb are celebrating the fifth anniversary of when they got their pet platypus, Perry. In commemoration, they create a giant shuttlecock and robotic replica figure of Perry to play an improvised game of badminton. However, when Perry's hovercraft accidentally collides with their shuttlecock, the boys crash into Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's laboratory and destroy his "Other-Dimension-Inator", which is designed to help him travel to parallel dimensions. Intrigued by the idea, the two help Doofenshmirtz rebuild the machine, while Perry arrives on his mission to stop Doofenshmirtz. Unwilling to give away his secret identity to the boys (which would get him relocated to another family), Perry reverts to his pet mode and is forced to watch them help Doofenshmirtz activate his invention.<br/>
The group is transported to an alternate dimension where a second, truly intelligent and evil Doofenshmirtz rules over his Tri-State Area. The second Perry (known as Platyborg), was converted into an evil cyborg by Doofenshimrtz-2 and programmed to serve as his second-in-command and general of his army of Norm-Bots. When the boys arrive with Perry to Doofenshmirtz-2's office, Doof-2 recognizes Perry as a secret agent and orders Platyborg to attack Perry. When that doesn't affect him, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Platyborg to attack the boys next, which forces Perry to reveal his secret identity to stop Platyborg from doing so, much to the others' shock. Doofenshmirtz-2 then sends several of his Norm Bots to catch Perry and the boys, but the trio escapes. Afterwards, Phineas expresses his anger at Perry for using him and Ferb as a cover for his double life.<br/>

<br/>
Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour on 9 February 1997.<br/>
<br/>
But police did not investigate his death as a murder as instructed by a Crown official.<br/>
<br/>
With the case now to be scrutinised by Merseyside Police, Kevin's uncle Allan Mcleod said: "After all this time we have to put our trust in someone."<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Mcleod, a 24-year-old electrician from Wick, was last seen alive on 8 February 1997 while on a night out with friends in the Caithness town.<br/>
<br/>
His body was recovered from the sea the following day.<br/>
<br/>
The Mcleod family has long campaigned for answers as to why no-one has been brought to justice for Kevin's death, and repeatedly complained about police handling of the case.<br/>
<br/>
Allan McLeod said this had left the family angry, frustrated with, and deeply suspicious of, Scotland's justice services.<br/>
<br/>
In 2017, Police Scotland said there had been "serious failings" on the part of the former Northern Constabulary, and officers had missed "the opportunity to gather vital evidence".<br/>
<br/>
The following year, the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe QC, instructed an experienced prosecutor to review police handling of Mr Mcleod's death. This review remains ongoing.<br/>
<br/>
This month, Police Scotland said it had asked officers from Merseyside Police to also review the case. <br/>
<br/>
Mr Mcleod said the family now hoped they were seeing signs of a breakthrough.<br/>
<br/>
He said: "After all these years we don't have just one review, but two. <br/>
<br/>
"It makes us think 'what have they found?'"<br/>
<br/>
The family were told of the Merseyside Police review in a meeting with police and Crown and Procurator Fiscal Service officials in Inverness.<br/>
<br/>
Mr Mcleod said the news came out of the blue.<br/>
<br/>
"We went into the meeting expecting more bad news," he said: <br/>
<br/>
"They let use say what we wanted to say and then told us Merseyside Police would review the case. We were shell-shocked."<br/>

Article: </span>(CNN) -- A South Carolina woman battling a rare flesh-eating bacteria infection has been upgraded to fair condition and is tentatively scheduled for skin-grafting surgery, her family said Thursday. Lana Kuykendall has been in Greenville Memorial Hospital since she was admitted on May 11, four days after giving birth to twins, Ian and Abigail, in Atlanta. "She has improved tremendously over the last week," said her husband, Darren Kuykendall. "Although she is still in ICU, we believe she is on the road to recovery." WYFF: New mom with flesh-eating bacteria sees twins . The constant IV drips of sedative and pain medicine have stopped and she is receiving them only as needed, Kuykendall said. "She looks more and more like herself." She has undergone almost 20 surgical procedures to treat and contain the spread of the necrotizing fasciitis, according to a statement from the hospital. Advocate: Story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness . "The treatment required aggressive surgical intervention, but not amputations," the statement said. "In addition to surgeries, she also underwent extensive hyperbaric oxygen therapy." The recovery process will be slow, according to the hospital's epidemiologist. However, "We believe she has turned the corner," Dr. Bill Kelly said. Kuykendall has had "longer periods of alertness and tries to respond to the people in the room and the conversations going on around her" over the last few days, the statement said. "She is able to communicate by blinking her eyes, raising her eyebrows, pointing and mouthing words." The 1-month-old twins, a boy and a girl, visited their mother for the first time at the hospital on Wednesday, the statement said. They are being cared for by relatives. Georgia flesh-eating bacteria victim speaks, jokes, father says . "Lana grinned from ear to ear when she was holding them," her husband said.

Article: </span>(CNN) -- College football's top-ranked LSU Tigers defeated the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide 9-6 in overtime Saturday night. LSU won the coin toss in overtime, electing to start on defense. The Crimson Tide's offense sputtered in the extra session with two incomplete passes, a penalty for having 12 men in the huddle and a sack for a 5-yard loss. Cade Foster, Alabama's placekicker, who had already missed three field goals earlier, missed another from 52 yards out. After that, LSU marched down the field, nearly scoring a touchdown but running back Michael Ford stepped out of bounds. Big game a work of heart . LSU elected to attempt a field goal and Drew Alleman-- who kicked two field goals earlier -- hit the 25-yard game-winner. The game, before a Bryant-Denny Stadium crowd in Tuscaloosa, mainly witnessed field goals and punts. Neither team scored a single touchdown. The low score might be surprising, given that the teams totaled 45 points in 2010, 39 in 2009 and 48 in 2008. The game was the first-ever SEC regular season game matching the country's two top teams, which were undefeated going into play. Both teams were among the nation's best when it came to defense and Saturday's game was no exception with LSU notching a field goal in the last seconds for a 3-3 tie going into halftime. Alabama missed two field goals in the first half. 'Game of the century' decided by kickers . The defensive standoff continued in the second half. Alabama went up 6-3 midway through the third quarter with a 46-yard field goal. LSU tied the game early in the fourth quarter with a 30-yard field goal. Recap: No.1 LSU vs. No. 2 Alabama . Going into the game, LSU had outscored its opponent by 222 points this year, according to the school's athletics website. The game, broadcast by CBS, was played under clear but cool skies. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.</p></div>

<p><span class='instruction'>Sum the following article in brief: </span>(Financial Times) -- Australia's resource-rich economy expanded at twice the pace expected by economists in the first quarter of 2012, lifted by an unexpected increase in household spending and continued heavy investment in mining projects. Gross domestic product advanced 1.3 per cent from the previous quarter, when it rose a revised 0.6 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This was well above market expectations of a 0.6 per cent rise and, excluding the quarter that followed the 2011 flooding in Queensland, was the fastest acceleration in economic growth in five years. In annual terms, GDP growth in the year to March was 4.3 per cent. The strong reading came a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its benchmark interest rate to 3.5 per cent -- the lowest level in almost three years -- because of "moderate domestic growth" and a "weaker and more uncertain international environment". Wednesday's report showed capital expenditure in the mining sector up 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and the main driver of a 20 per cent increase in private infrastructure investment. But it was a 1.6 per cent rise in household spending during the quarter that surprised the market. "Despite their negativity about a lack of wealth growth and cost of living increases, the consumer is spending money," said UBS economist Scott Haslem. Treasurer Wayne Swan hailed the figures as "stunning" and said they showcased the "rock-solid economic fundamentals" that put Australia in a "league of its own". "This is a remarkable outcome and reaffirms Australia's position as one of the strongest economies in the world, with the Australian economy growing faster than every single major advanced economy in the March quarter," said Mr Swan. But economists said the data, which preceded the latest bout of global economic worries, might prove to be the growth peak for Australia, and highlighted the unevenness in growth between the mining and non-mining sectors of the economy.

<p><span class='instruction'>Article: </span>Ivor Gifford, of Abertillery, sent messages to two fake online profiles and arranged to meet a girl.<br/>
He told Newport Crown Court he thought the people he was messaging were older than they claimed.<br/>
Mr Gifford denies inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity.<br/>
He also denies one charge of online grooming.<br/>
The court had previously heard Mr Gifford had been arrested when he went to meet one of the children after fake profiles were set up by a group called the Hunted One, which had been monitoring his online conversations.<br/>
Speaking in his defence, Mr Gifford said he had gone on to the sites to meet people in their 50s and 60s for friendship and to try to find a housekeeper.<br/>
He denied looking for under-18s and said he assumed all websites had an age requirement.<br/>
He said he felt the photographs shown of the girls he was messaging showed them as being between 17 and 21 or older.<br/>
"When I first saw the age as 11 my curiosity said to me 'what is a young lady of 11 doing on an adult site? Where are her parents and guardians?'"<br/>
He admitted the sexual content of his messages, saying: "By talking in a sexual manner on this site you could get answers."<br/>
He told the court he had sent pictures of his penis to both fake profiles "by accident - I never intended to send them anything in the nude".<br/>
Mr Gifford described his contact with both fake profiles as "banter, a bit of fun".<br/>
"I was never trying to be serious with Jodie or Jessie," he said.<br/>
"I have no interest in juveniles whatsoever. They were not juveniles to me - they looked a lot older."<br/>
The court heard he had asked "Jessie" to come and meet him. "It was just banter but if she wanted to come for a very short time, with no strings attached, that would be that," he said.<br/>
He told the court it would be a way of proving if she existed, but he had then asked her not to come.<br/>
"If she was the age she said she was, I wouldn't feel happy with her coming to my house. I'd feel ashamed of being associated with her if she existed," he said.<br/>
He added he did not expect sex...<br/>

Three fire engines and a search and rescue team were called to the scene. An investigation is now underway, the fire service said.<br/>
Norfolk deputy fire officer Roy Harold said the building was unsafe and "literally coming apart at the seams".<br/>
It was too early to identify a cause of the explosion, he said.<br/>
The man and woman, who were taken to nearby James Paget Hospital, were not thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries, he added.<br/>

Thomson, from Gosport, and his design team have been working for two years on his new Hugo Boss yacht, which is 5% lighter than the previous version.<br/>
The 41-year-old's target is victory in the Vendee Globe from November 2016.<br/>
"Preparation is key. Today is about learning, in a year's time it's about winning." he told BBC South Today.<br/>
Thomson finished third during the last edition of what is often dubbed "the Everest of sailing".<br/>
The Vendee Globe is a non-stop, solo, unassisted race which takes around three months to complete.<br/>
Welsh-born Thomson will put the new yacht through its paces in the double-handed Transat Jacques Vabre race from Le Havre to South America later this month with co-skipper Guillermo Altadill.<br/>
"We're extremely excited as the boat took a year and 40,000 man-hours to build, but we're also quite nervous," Thomson added.<br/>
"The first time we'll find out if the boat is fast enough is at the first race in three weeks' time. She seems to be going well and she looks the part.<br/>
"Whether she'll be reliable enough, we'll have to wait."<br/>
His third place at the last Vendee Globe in January 2013 made Thomson only the third Briton to finish on the event's podium after Ellen MacArthur and Mike Golding, in 2001 and 2005 respectively.<br/>
In just over a year's time, he wants to stand on top spot.<br/>
"The Vendee Globe has been my life for 12 years," he said.<br/>
"The whole team are focused on that job and this boat gives us a tremendous platform."<br/>

<p><span class='instruction'>Review: </span>I received a complimentary stay at Caesar's Palace for two nights.  Right off the bat, I should not be picky at all, BUT I would like to share with others my brief experience staying at one of the more expensive hotels on the strip.<br/>
First we were issued one of the Augustus Tower rooms, one of the nicest towers, but when I requested an UPGRADE for two instead of one beds, we were not only downgraded, but was issued a different room at the opposite tower which was your basic stay room with nothing fancy.  The room, I will tell you now, is just like any other room on the strip if you were looking for something comfortable.  There is nothing fancy about a basic room at Caesars so definitely save your money for another hotel OR get a better room at Caesars if you want the full experience.  In addition, there was lipstick found on the bedsheets upon entering the room, the light shades were a bit broken, and the view faced the side parking lot.  We asked repeatedly for a different room but EVERYTHING was booked that weekend.<br/>
Like I said, I should not be picky since it was comped but the experience and the downgrade left me feeling a little empty from the hotel experience side of Vegas.  Again, unless you are getting a really nice room at the Augustus Tower, save your money for another hotel.<br/>

Together with his African companion, the mysterious Umbopo (Ken Gampu), they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a stereotypical, single-minded, knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine.The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force.The Germans follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely.

Arab group Khalas (Arabic for "Enough") and Jewish band Orphaned Land are heading out on an 18-day European tour that they hope will foster tolerance between the two sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<p>(CNN) -- The powerful Service Employees International Union has decided that, because of the $700 billion financial-system bailout, it wants to organize bank workers. Banks that get taxpayer money need to "ensure their workers have a voice," a union spokeswoman says. In an e-mail dated November 12 and obtained exclusively by CNN, a member of SEIU's Private Equity Project outlined initial discussions to organize bank workers "since the banking industry is now being infused with billions of taxpayer dollars." The e-mail was written by SEIU's Inga Skippings to the director of the Washington office of the Association of Community Organizing for Reform Now (ACORN), a longtime ally and partner of the union.<br/>

Washington (CNN) -- BP, Transocean and Halliburton all share responsibility for the deadly explosion that resulted in the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to the final federal report on the matter released Wednesday. The three companies "violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations," according to the report, which includes a series of recommendations for improving drilling safety. The report, issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, concludes that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the Macondo well site. "The precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known," the report states. But the disaster was "the result of poor risk management, last minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling" at the site.</p></div>
<div class='output_div'>
<p>Meanwhile, Halliburton -- a BP contractor -- was "responsible for conducting the cement job, and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well," the report says.</p></div>

Robert Durst's family is so scared of the suspected-murderer that they have taken out a restraining order against him, even though he is currently behind bars without bail. A New Orleans judge has approved an order of protection, preventing Durst from contacting his brother Douglas, head of family business Durst Corp, and other members of Douglas' family. The former real estate heir was arrested this week on charges related to the murder of his long-time friend Susan Berman, who was killed execution-style in 2000.

While speaking to overseas Filipino workers in South Korea on Sunday night he invited two Filipino women to the stage. He gave them a book, and the BBC describes the pair as "visibly star struck." He exchanged a hug and kiss on the cheek with the first woman, but motioned—repeatedly, and for some time—for the second woman to kiss him on the lips before he moved toward her and planted one there. During their roughly 50-second exchange, CNN reports Duterte asked the woman if she was single (she's not), saying "You're not separated from [your husband]?" Reuters reports the 73-year-old Duterte downplayed the kiss, telling the crowd, "Don't take it seriously. It's just for fun, a gimmick." The woman, identified as Bea Kim, framed it similarly, saying there was "no malice" in the situation; online commenters and female politicians in the country weren't as forgiving, with one calling it a "grave abuse of authority." "The fact that you thought that kissing the woman would entertain people ... that’s something really sick," said the secretary-general of Gabriela Women's Party.<span class='instruction'>", I became interested.

 <br/>
 Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has drawn criticism for kissing an overseas Filipina worker on the lips during a live event. <br/>
 <br/>
 Mr Duterte was speaking to a crowd in South Korea when he called the woman on stage then convinced her to kiss him. <br/>
 <br/>
 The scene drew cheers from the crowd, mostly made of up other Philippine workers. <br/>
 <br/>
 But it was described as "disgusting theatrics of a misogynist president" by Philippines rights group Gabriela. <br/>
 <br/>
 The woman involved later said that there was "no malice" in the kiss. <br/>
 <br/>
 It is not the first time Mr Duterte has been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards women. <br/>
 <br/>
 The controversial incident took place when Mr Duterte was speaking to a crowd of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Seoul. <br/>
 <br/>
 Two Philippine women were invited to join the president on stage to receive a free copy of a book, and were visibly star struck standing next to Mr Duterte. <br/>
 <br/>
 He hugged the first and gave her a kiss on the cheek before gesturing the second woman to kiss him on the lips. <br/>
 <br/>
 After a protracted back and forth, with nervous laughter from the young woman and repeated gestures by Mr Duterte, the president eventually leaned in to kiss the woman on the lips. <br/>
 <br/>
 Online complaints <br/>
 <br/>
 While the young woman was laughing and the crowd cheering, comments on the internet were a lot more critical. <br/>
 <br/>
 Women's rights group Gabriela condemned the event, saying it was part of a bigger effort to deflect from real policy issues and Mr Duterte's waning popularity. <br/>
 <br/>
 "His repeated acts of machismo are meant as entertainment to hide the reality of his rapidly slipping popularity due to the issues of extrajudicial killings, the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion law and big-time corruption scandals now plaguing his rule," it said in a statement on Monday. <br/>

<div class='output_div'>
<p>The USB standard specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors to minimize physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present in some other connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.</p></div>

<p>Then, slide the crimping bead in, and then add another bead about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so down. Keep in mind that you're not yet transferring your design onto the thread. These are necessary, preliminary steps that will secure your necklace. Then, make a loop with the stringing material. Then add the bead-crimp-bead combo, and use the crimping tool/chain nose pliers to crimp the bead into place.  If using bead thread, you may wish to put a dot of super glue of hypo cement on either end to ensure that the beads and crimp stay on.) These steps will protect the stringing material from rubbing on the ends of the crimp bead, which may cause the necklace to break. Once you're satisfied with your design, carefully remove one bead at a time, and string it onto the thread. Be sure to leave about 3-4  inches (7.5-10 cm) of stringing material at the end.  Thread beads onto the stringing material until there are none left on your bead board. Try to push the remaining stringing material into the bead holes below the crimping bead.  Be careful not to pull the stringing material too tight. Leave a small amount of slack in the necklace (2-4 mm or 1/4 inch).  This leaves room for the beads to move and rotate, so they don't rub on each other or the stringing material too much.  If the stringing material is too tight the necklace will be rigid and this can make the design look angular instead of slightly rounded like a necklace should be. It is not recommended that you cut the wire too close to the crimp bead. 1 inch (2.5 cm) of wire, carefully hidden in the bead holes, is good insurance against breakage.</p></div>

The Unite union said the job losses will affect 65 employees and 75 agency workers in manufacturing roles.<br/>
<br/>
The firm employs about 2,000 people across its County Antrim plants at Larne, west Belfast and Monkstown.<br/>
<br/>
The company confirmed it is seeking 65 voluntary staff redundancies but has not yet commented on agency workers.<br/>

In a statement, a spokesperson for Caterpillar said: "Current weaknesses in the economies of some key markets are impacting on demand for some of our products. <br/>
<br/>
"The company is therefore taking appropriate measures during this time to help ensure the competitiveness of the business. <br/>
<br/>
"We will continue to closely monitor the economic environment and will continue to communicate with employees."<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"The timing of this announcement is particularly difficult for the workforce coming in the mouth of Christmas," Mr Thompson added.<br/>
<br/>
"Unite is committed to securing the very best possible terms for all our members affected by this decision."<br/>
<br/>
The US firm bought one of Northern Ireland's most famous manufacturing companies, FG Wilson, in 1999 and last year it renamed the County Antrim firm as Caterpillar (Northern Ireland).<br/>
<br/>
In September 2012, the firm cut more than 700 jobs as it moved some manufacturing to China.<br/>

It later added about 200 jobs in a "shared services centre" which provides back-office support for Caterpillar's global operations.</p></div>

<p>The ban applies to travellers from countries which are members of the Schengen border-free travel area.<br/>
<br/>
The UK, Ireland and other non-Schengen countries are unaffected. US citizens are also exempt. <br/>
<br/>
The EU condemned the measures, which it said were taken "unilaterally and without consultation".<br/>
<br/>
The new rules go into effect on Friday at midnight EDT (0400 GMT) and mark a major escalation from the US president, who has been accused of inaction over the coronavirus.<br/>
<br/>
There are 1,135 confirmed cases of the virus across the US, with 38 deaths so far.<br/>

Shares around the world fell further following Mr Trump's announcement. At the start of US trading, shares plunged triggering an automatic temporary suspension in trading aimed at curbing panicky selling.<br/>

What else did the US president say? <br/>
<br/>
"This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history," he said in a prime-time televised address from the Oval Office on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Justifying the travel restrictions, he accused the EU of failing to take "the same precautions" as the US in fighting the virus.<br/>
<br/>
In his speech he said all travel from Europe would be suspended, but a presidential proclamation later said it would only apply to anyone who had been in the EU's Schengen border-free area in the 14 days before their arrival in the US. <br/>
<br/>
Mr Trump also said the suspension would also apply to cargo coming from Europe into the US. He later tweeted to say that trade would "in no way be affected".<br/>
<br/>
The speech included plans to provide billions of dollars in loans to small businesses and the president urged Congress to free up more funds.<br/>

President Trump said for most Americans the risk was "very, very low" adding, "no nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States".<br/>

<span class='instruction'>Given the above title of an imaginary article, imagine the article.</span><br/>
</p></div>
<div class='output_div'>
<p>The incident, which happened near disputed East China Sea islands last month, sparked angry responses in both capitals with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling it a "dangerous act" and China asking Tokyo to stop "illegal" activities.<br/>
<br/>
Newspapers and experts in both countries followed suit, with leading Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun calling the incident a "dangerously provocative act".<br/>
<br/>
Global Times said Tokyo was giving a "one-sided" argument over the issue but official news agency Xinhua, The People's Daily and CCTV have not commented on the issue. <br/>
<br/>
China<br/>
<br/>
An editorial in Beijing's Global Times says Japan has highlighted the radar incident "to sound an alert" between the Chinese and Japanese public. "If the Abe administration's real intention is to implant the idea of an imminent war in the minds of the public, China also must send the same message to the Chinese public," the editorial adds.<br/>
<br/>
A commentary in the Beijing News says Mr Abe wants to strengthen weaponry and even revise the peace constitution. "The US' attitude is cautious and noncommittal on all this. On the eve of (Shinzo Abe's) upcoming visit to the US, using 'radar targeting' to hype up a 'China threat' as a bargaining chip to persuade the US to 'relax restraints' may be the Abe cabinet's painstakingly crafted ruse," the commentary says.<br/>
<br/>
An editorial in Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po says Japan has "other motives in being the guilty party accusing the victim" over this issue. "When visiting the US at the end of February, Abe hopes that US President Obama will have a 'positive' stance on softening restrictions on Japan's right to collective self-defence... To win more bargaining chips, Japan chose this moment to suddenly create the tense atmosphere of an imminent Sino-Japanese military conflict to seek concessions from the US on easing restrictions on its right of collective self-defence," the editorial in the Hong Kong-based newspaper adds.<br/>

<div class='output_div'>
<p>They found the encryption system used in many car immobilisers can be cracked, potentially letting a thief steal the car.<br/>
Vehicles made by 26 separate car firms including Volkswagen, Porsche and Honda use the "weak" security system.<br/>
The researchers first released their findings two years ago but legal action prevented publication.<br/>
Security researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio Garcia, and Baris Ege from Radboud University in Holland investigated the encryption system used by the Megamos immobiliser.<br/>
This stops a car engine being started if the correct radio chip in a key fob is not close by.<br/>
These systems can be fooled with boosters that amplify the signal on the corresponding chip but the researchers took a different approach that tackled the data passing between car keys and the Megamos system.<br/>
Eavesdropping on the exchange of data between the car key and crypto system a couple of times gave the trio useful hints about which secret key was being used to scramble the data.<br/>
This helped them find which cryptographic key was being used in about 30 minutes. Some car makers were using very weak secret keys that could be found in just a few minutes using a laptop.<br/>
In a paper describing their work, the three researchers said it was "trivial" to accomplish the attack on the immobiliser system. The research was completed three years ago but legal action by Volkswagen and French defence group Thales initially prevented publication. The restrictions on publication have now been lifted after the paper was edited.<br/>
The BBC has contacted Megamos for a comment but the company has not yet responded.<br/>
Fixing the flaws in the cryptographic system overseeing the data exchange will be hard as it involves replacing radio chips in car key fobs and the corresponding hardware in affected vehicles.<br/>
The team said it had been talking to car makers about its findings, and measures had been taken to prevent some of the attacks working.<br/>
The paper comes after several other security researchers revealed ways to take over in-car computer systems....</p></div>
